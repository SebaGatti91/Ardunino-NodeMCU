# Ardunino-NodeMCU

## Project Description

This project involves the development of an Arduino project with NodeMCU communication. It includes the control of a shooting platform with a propeller through a Wi-Fi network generated by NodeMCU and motor control on Arduino Uno. The user interface is developed using pure HTML with JavaScript.

## Key Components

- **Arduino Uno:**
  - Responsible for motor control and other tasks.

- **NodeMCU:**
  - Facilitates communication and generates a Wi-Fi network for platform control.

## Features

- Control of a shooting platform with a propeller through a Wi-Fi network.
- Motor control using Arduino Uno.
- User interface development using pure HTML and JavaScript.
